4:12:41 PM?I have created a private repo in mvfs already, and at my desktop ran
git remote add jcui mvfs.mv.dev.ilog.com:/ilog/home/jcui/git/cplex
git fetch jcui
as the GitBestPractices said, while, I don't know these 2 lines used for?
After that, I changed a file in cplex/matlab/test/testcases/etsp.m and run git commit -a at my desktop.
but I didn't see any changes in my private repo.
If I want to commit the local change to my private repo, should I run git push?
furthermore, if I want to commit the change to our central repo, what should I do?
The above is my problem.
4:25:20 PMRobert Schiele...Ok, if you want to push your local branch "foobar" to your private repository on mvfs you do a "git push jcui foobar". Alternatively you can just make the private repository an _exact_ copy of your local repository with "git push jcui --mirror". 
4:25:51 PM?To get your local change to the central repository you just use "origin" instead of "jcui". 
4:26:15 PM?_Never_ use --mirror with the central repository, _only_ with your private one! 
4:27:17 PMJohn Cui/China...thanks, but I don't have any branch in my opinion, I have only master so far 
4:27:46 PMRobert Schiele...Well, master is a branch like all the others, just that it is called "master". 
4:28:50 PMJohn Cui/China...ok, then I do git push jcui master can commit the changes to private repo, and git push origin master can commit the changes to central repo? 
4:29:08 PMRobert Schiele...Exactly. 
4:36:33 PMJohn Cui/China...after I did git push jcui master at my desktop, I goto mvfs:/ilog/home/jcui/git/cplex/.../etsp.m, it isn't changed. 
4:37:43 PMRobert Schiele...No. You should not work directly in that repository but instead clone it on the target system. 
4:38:08 PMJohn Cui/China...and every time I ssh to mvfs the path is /home/jcui not /ilog/home/jcui 
4:38:30 PMRobert Schiele...Yes, this is expected behavior. 
4:38:46 PMJohn Cui/China...I worked at in my local machine, not in private repo 
4:39:27 PM?I just want to check git push jcui master commit the changes correctly 
4:39:47 PM?so I goto the private repo to see the file etsp.m was changed or not 
4:40:03 PMRobert Schiele...You cannot check that by looking at files. You can check that though by "git log" and verifying that the change in question is listed. 
4:41:30 PMJohn Cui/China... 
4:42:18 PM?My commit is in the log, but why the file in private repo wasn't changed? 
4:42:51 PMRobert Schiele...This is because for technical reasons the files don't get automatically updated. If you really want to update them you have to run "git reset --hard". 
4:43:24 PMJohn Cui/China...Ah, run this command in mvfs? 
4:43:38 PMRobert Schiele...But what I see in your log is that you did not yet configure your name correctly. Please use your full name in the log so that people can clearly identify the author of your changes. 
4:43:42 PM?Yes. 
4:44:05 PMJohn Cui/China...both in my desktop and mvfs? 
4:44:31 PMRobert Schiele...Yes please. 
4:44:35 PMJohn Cui/China...OK  
4:44:43 PMRobert Schiele...Basically on every machine you use git. 
4:46:39 PM?I don't know how exactly you typically write your full name. In Sametime you are listed as "Yongzhi John Cui" at one place and as "You Zhi Cui" at another one. Use whatever you prefer. But using your real name is prefered over just your account name "jcui" since "jcui" is not helpful for finding you in Bluepages. 
4:47:10 PMJohn Cui/China...My full name is John Cui 
4:47:19 PM?Chinese name is You Zhi Cui  
4:47:35 PM?Yongzhi is wrong by IBM person 
4:47:47 PM?so I will use John Cui to replace jcui? 
4:47:58 PMRobert Schiele...Ok, as I said, use whatever you prefer and think is most useful for finding you.
